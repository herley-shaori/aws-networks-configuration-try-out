# ðŸ¤– Agent Automation Log

## Date: 2025-06-26

### Actions Performed
- Created and configured an ALB with two EC2 instances in Jakarta (ap-southeast-3), each in a different AZ.
- Ensured public subnets, IGW, route tables, and security groups are set up for public access and secure load balancing.
- Verified that EC2s serve unique content and are registered with the ALB.
- Updated `readme.md` with a clear, step-by-step, emoji-rich guide for easy reproducibility.
- Next: Test if `terraform init` can be performed successfully in this directory.
